This document provides a step-by-step guide to compiling and running existing source code on Visual Studio. The following instructions assume that you have already installed Visual Studio on your machine and have downloaded the source code you wish to compile and run.



Step 1: Opening the Project

Open Visual Studio and select Open a project or solution.
Navigate to the directory where you have saved the source code files and select the appropriate file, such as a .sln file for a Visual Studio solution or a .vcxproj file for a C++ project.
Click Open.



Step 2: Building the Project

Once your project is open, click Build in the top menu and then select Build Solution. This will compile the code and generate an executable file.
Check the output window for any errors or warnings.



Step 3: Running the Program

Click Debug in the top menu and then select Start Without Debugging or simply press Ctrl + F5 on your keyboard. This will run the program without attaching a debugger.
If you want to debug the program, select Start Debugging or simply press F5 on your keyboard.



Step 4: Debugging the Program

If the program encounters an error or you want to step through the code, select Debug in the top menu and then select Start Debugging or simply press F5 on your keyboard.
Use the Breakpoints window to add breakpoints to the code.
When the breakpoint is hit, you can use the Debug menu to step through the code, view variable values, and execute individual code statements.



Conclusion

By following these simple steps, you can quickly and easily compile and run existing source code on Visual Studio. If you encounter any errors or issues during the process, consult the documentation or seek assistance from the original source of the code.
