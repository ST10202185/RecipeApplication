Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from the official website (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

Steps:

Clone or Download the Project:
Clone the TimeManager project from your version control system (e.g., Git) or download it as a ZIP file from the repository if you have it hosted online (e.g., on GitHub).

Open Visual Studio:
Launch Visual Studio on your computer.

Open the Project:
In Visual Studio, click on "File" in the top menu.
Select "Open" and then choose "Project/Solution."
Navigate to the folder where you cloned or downloaded the TimeManager project and select the solution file (usually with a .sln extension).
Click "Open" to open the project in Visual Studio.

Restore NuGet Packages:
Once the project is open, right-click on the solution name in the Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages." This will ensure that all necessary libraries and dependencies are downloaded.

Build the Solution:
After restoring NuGet packages, right-click on the solution name in the Solution Explorer again and select "Build" (or just press F6). This will compile the application.

Set the Startup Project:
Right-click on the project that contains the MainWindow.xaml file (usually named after your application) and select "Set as StartUp Project." This designates which project will run when you press the "Start" button.

Run the Application:
Press F5 or click the "Start" button in the Visual Studio toolbar. This will build and run the TimeManager application.

Use the Application:
The TimeManager application's main window will appear, allowing you to interact with it. You can add modules, calculate self-study hours, and perform other actions as defined in your application.

Debugging:
If you encounter any issues, you can set breakpoints in your code to debug. To do this, simply click in the margin to the left of the code line where you want to set a breakpoint. When you run the application in Debug mode, it will pause at these breakpoints, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.

Stop the Application:
To stop the running application, click the "Stop" button (usually a red square) in the Visual Studio toolbar
